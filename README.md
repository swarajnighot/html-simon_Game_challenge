The Simon Game is a classic electronic memory game that challenges players to repeat a sequence of colored lights and sounds. The game consists of a circular device with four colored buttons: red, blue, green, and yellow. The device randomly generates a sequence of button presses, lighting up the corresponding colors and playing associated sounds.
